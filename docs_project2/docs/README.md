Docs for Ticketing System
=========================

This folder is for documentation artifacts that should render on GitHub, such as architecture diagrams, class diagrams, ADRs, postmortems, and debugging notes.

Place your diagram images here using the exact filenames below so the root README can reference them:

- `project2architecture_diagram.png`
- `project2_class_diagram.png`

If you have the files locally (for example on your machine at `/home/mihir/Pictures/Screenshots/`), copy them into this folder:

  cp /home/mihir/Pictures/Screenshots/project2architecture_diagram.png docs/project2architecture_diagram.png
  cp /home/mihir/Pictures/Screenshots/project2_class_diagram.png docs/project2_class_diagram.png

Suggested subfolders and files
- `docs/adr/` — Architectural Decision Records (one Markdown file per decision). Example template:

  # ADR <number>: Title
  - Status: proposed/accepted/declined
  - Context: ...
  - Decision: ...
  - Consequences: ...

- `docs/debug/` — debugging notes and common fixes
- `docs/postmortems/` — incident reports

Notes
- I could not access the screenshots on your local machine from this environment, so please copy the diagram PNGs into `docs/` so they will be visible on GitHub.
